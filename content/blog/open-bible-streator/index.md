# Open Bible Streator
This website was the culmination of my experience as a freelance web designer and developer. It was a great opportunity to put all of my skills and lessons learned into practice, working with clients to create a beautiful and well-executed project. The end result was a website that met the content's goals and exceeded their expectations.

## Project Rundown

Open Bible Streator was an amazing experience to lead and the client was an absolute pleasure to work with. This was the last website I developed in WordPress before switching to development with React and Gatsby, and was built with all of my academic education and work experience in web development.
